            <p>I want to make a custom language and compiler</p>
            <p>The code will only be written with a single character, which is yet to be decided.</p>
            <p>The compiler will read the code, and depending on the quantity of characters read in succession, it will create a different token</p>
            <p>The compiler will seperate statements when it reaches whitespace or newline</p>
            <p></p>
